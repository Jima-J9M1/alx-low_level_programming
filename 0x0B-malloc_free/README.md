# Dynamic Memory Allocation

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**.It aim to learn how to debug in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* D files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.4 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| FileName | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-create_array.c` | create an array of chars,  and initializes it with a specific char. |
|`1-strdup.c` | Return a pointer to newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter. |
|`2-str_concat.c` | Concatenates two strings.|
|`3-alloc_grid.c`| Returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.|
|`4-free_grid.c` | function that frees a 2 dimensional grid |
